To do:

- [ ] have a proper description here and in other READMEs
- [ ] upload final code / plots
- [ ] write down paths to files on the cluster

For the paper:
- [ ] make a repo for all the code (with Rai and possibly Fedya)
- [ ] start writing methods 
- [ ] rewrite Mathematica code?

Current state of things: ver18, ver19 not scaling sigma in Fedya's code, but now it does not work for large abs mu and small sigma because we have a cut-off on the distribution of s; change it to something else sinse s is not limited by -1 and 1 (maybe we should start taking exp(s))?
