Trying to finish this! Just copying whatever code I run and trying to organize stuff.

To do:
- (done: more than 0.01 above the sim 0.0005 treshold) find areas to exclude from plots (where there are too many positive fitness effects: Fedya's rns diverges from Rai's) by choosing a treshold % value for very advantageous s; find curve by computing integral of pdf of the skew normal distribution and probably use reg on mathematica's contour plots; this is not working; might need to precompute that integral for each point on the grid and make another contour plot with some transparent and white contours and overlay; I MUST HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE LOOK UP OLD CODE ON THE DRIVE;
- (done) looks at the plots: first, rns hets on rns hets, then also rns pols, and sbs hets and pols; how was I doing that before?? is there a better way?? what do they tell us??
- LOOK AT RUNS DYNAMICS AND FIND DISTRIBUTIONS?
- think if I want to run lethals as well â€“ probably yes; what would I need for that?? analytically, change hets for rns; plot; find points where zero error; run Fedya's code (will probably take anoter two weeks eh)
- write to Fedya and Rai before running lethals? start writing? generally, orgamize my thoughts and notes
