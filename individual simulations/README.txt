In this directory, there are several models written in Rust that run individual based models. SBS folder contains the model that has a gamma distribution of selection coefficients, with lethal alleles are fully recessive and all other alleles in the distribution having a dominance coefficient of 0.5. The results of these simulations, summarized by the get_averages.pl Perl script, were used to create Figures 3e,f. All other folders contain individual models where for each run all of the alleles have the same selection and dominance coefficients - these simulations were used to create Figures 3a-d.
